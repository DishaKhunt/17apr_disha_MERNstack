8. What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints
Answer:-
    => SQL key constraints used to define rules or restriction on cloumn or set of column in a table to ensure data intigrity and enforce uniqueness and referential integrity.
    => There are three type of constraints SQL keys:-
        1. primary Key 
        2. Unique Key
        3. Foreign Key1



        1. primary Key :-
            => Primary key is a column of table which uniquely identifies each row in that table.
            => Only one primary key is allowed to use in a table.
            => The primary key does not accept the any duplicate and NULL values.
            => Example:-
                        CREATE TABLE Student
                        (
                            Sid int(5) PRIMARY KEY,
                            Sname varchar(10)
                        );

        2. Unique Key :-
            => Unique key constraints also identifies an individual table uniquely in a relation or table.
            => A table can have more than one unique key unlike primary key.
            => Unique key constraints can accept only one NULL value for column.
            => Example:-
                        CREATE TABLE Student
                        (
                            Sid int(5),
                            Sname varchar(10),
                            Sphno int(11) UNIQUE
                        );

        3. Foreign Key :-
            => When, "one" table's primary key field is added to a related "many" table in order to create the common field which relates the two tables, it is called a foreign key in the "many" table.
            => Example:-
                    CREATE TABLE Student
                    (
                        Sid int(5),
                        Sname varchar(10),
                        Course_name varchar(20),
                        FOREIGN KEY (Course_name) REFERENCE Faculty(Course_name)
                    );
