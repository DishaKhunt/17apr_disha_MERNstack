2. What is Normalization?
Answer:-
    => Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy (duplicity) from a relation or set of relations.
    => Redundancy in relation used is insertion, deletion and updation anomalies. 
    => it helps to minimize the redundancy in relations.
    => Most Commonly used normal forms:
        1) First Normal Form (1NF)
        2) Second Normal Form (2NF)
        3) Third Normal Form (3NF)
        4) Boyce & Code Normal Form (BCNF)
